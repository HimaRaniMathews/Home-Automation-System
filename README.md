# Home-Automation-System

<div align="justify">
This home automation project involves various ideas that will help the consumer in terms of -
monitoring, power consumption, security. So, in this project we are developing three different
Arduino projects, i.e., Smoke Detection System, Motion controlled LEDs and Door Lock System.
In the development of this project, we have made sure that the final product uses components
such that, the space occupied by the final product is minimal, the devices are user friendly, and
the devices can be afforded by the general public.
The project contains a micro-controller like Arduino that help the consumer wirelessly control
lights or automatically turn off lights in case no motion detected to save power consumption, it
also contains a door lock keypad system to increase security in sensitive areas, a fire alarm system
that detects smoke emission and hence helps us to extinguish the fire.
